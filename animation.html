                <h1>2023 Animation: The Wait</h1>
                <h2>My First Experience With Animation</h2>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    In "The Wait," I crafted an animation story that delves into the heartwarming journey of an injured cat and a compassionate man who unexpectedly 
                    cross paths. The narrative unfolds as the man discovers the vulnerable and wounded cat, sparking an unforeseen bond between them. Spending time 
                    together, we find solace in each other's presence, gradually filling the voids of loneliness in our hearts.

                    The essence of "The Wait" lies in its exploration of companionship, empathy, and healing. Through our connection, both the cat and I undergo a 
                    transformation, finding comfort and support in each other's company. The story illustrates how acts of kindness and understanding can transcend 
                    barriers, offering hope and warmth even in adversity.

                    My primary objective with this project was to create an interactive story using animation as my chosen medium of expression. By immersing audiences 
                    in a visually captivating narrative, I aimed to resonate with themes of compassion and resilience. Through engaging storytelling and emotive visuals,
                     "The Wait" invites viewers to embark on a poignant journey of connection and healing, leaving a lasting impression on their hearts and minds.

                <h3>Background and Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of my studies in my media arts minor, I embarked on the development and exploration of animation as a medium of artistic expression. 
                    Motivated by my passion for storytelling and visual arts, I chose to delve into animation with the aspiration of venturing into the dynamic 
                    realm of the 3D animation industry.

                    My journey with animation was driven by a desire to immerse myself in a creative field that merges technical skills with artistic vision. 
                    With a keen interest in coding, special effects, and software such as Blender, I sought to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the 
                    intricacies involved in bringing animated stories to life.

                    By undertaking projects like "The Wait," I aimed to hone my skills in animation while also delving into the nuances of storytelling and 
                    character development. Through this hands-on experience, I strived to gain practical knowledge and insights that would prepare me for a 
                    future career in the 3D animation industry.

                    Moreover, my exploration of animation served as a platform for personal growth and artistic development. It provided me with an opportunity 
                    to push the boundaries of creativity, experiment with different techniques, and refine my abilities as a visual storyteller.

                    Ultimately, the purpose of my animation endeavors was twofold: to lay the groundwork for a future career in the 3D animation industry and 
                    to nurture my passion for storytelling through the captivating medium of animation. Through dedication, perseverance, and a commitment to 
                    artistic excellence, I aimed to create meaningful and impactful animated experiences that resonate with audiences and inspire imagination.

                <h3>Development Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    Creating "The Wait" presented significant challenges due to limited resources, namely an iPad and Procreate. I had to research various software 
                    options, like DaVinci Resolve, to complement my workflow. Finding suitable sound effects was also demanding, but I ultimately utilized Epidemic Sounds. 
                    Despite constraints, I persevered, showcasing resourcefulness and determination to bring the animation to life.
