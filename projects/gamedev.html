                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    "In The Present" is an interactive and explorative game set in a dreamlike world, emphasizing the importance of self-reflection in 
                    understanding one's true desires and priorities. Players navigate through the character KJ's story by interacting with objects in her 
                    room, uncovering her subconscious struggles and fears while remaining unaware of the dreamlike realm they've entered. The game's obstacles 
                    symbolize KJ's internal conflicts, leading players through challenges that reflect her journey of self-discovery and gradual awareness of 
                    her emotional state.

                <h3>Background and Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of my studies in my Media Arts minor, I undertook the development of 'In The Present' as part of my projects in Environments 
                    and Transposition. This project challenged me to use the Unity game engine to recreate a familiar environment, allowing me to explore 
                    the concept of transmitting the parameters of ecosystems through artistic expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The background and purpose behind "In The Present" stem from personal experiences within a new dorm environment, which witnessed various 
                    emotional ups and downs, including moments of growth, loneliness, and self-discovery. Inspired by Gaetano DiNardi's observation that 
                    professionals often prioritize work over personal fulfillment, the game aims to shed light on the struggle of balancing career aspirations 
                    with personal passions and relationships.
                </p>        
                <p>
                    The choice of setting, my dormitory, holds personal significance, representing a recent hurdle in my life journey. Despite feelings of 
                    loneliness and homesickness, the dorm became a place of immense growth and self-discovery. This project allows me to express a side of myself 
                    rarely shared, reflecting the journey of self-discovery and uncertainties experienced in that space.
                </p>        
                <p>
                    The relevance and importance of "In The Present" extend beyond personal experience, resonating with individuals facing similar challenges 
                    in balancing personal and professional lives. Barbara de Angelis's quote underscores the game's core message: that true happiness lies in 
                    finding balance and fostering personal well-being. By sharing my experiences through this game, I hope to encourage others to reflect on 
                    their own priorities and seek fulfillment in all aspects of life.

                <h3>Development Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    During the development of my game, I encountered several hurdles that put my skills to the test. Learning C# and player teleportation were
                    quite the challenges, especially considering my limited experience with Unity and scripting. Scene management posed another obstacle, 
                    particularly in ensuring the game remained compact in size. Crafting a compelling narrative was another uphill battle. Implementing dialogue
                    systems and smooth transitions required significant trial and error. Technical issues also cropped up along the way, including time-consuming
                    game backups and building processes, compounded by using an outdated version of Unity. Lastly, managing my own excitement and ideas proved 
                    challenging as I balanced ambition with feasibility within the given time frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite these challenges, I persevered and found innovative solutions to each obstacle. Relying on resources like W3Schools, Unity's online 
                    manual, and supportive online forums, I deepened my understanding of C# and its application within Unity. Utilizing existing builds and an 
                    interaction-based teleportation system, I ensured seamless scene transitions and compact game size. Updating to the latest version of Unity 
                    resolved technical issues, significantly improving efficiency in backup and building processes. While I had to scale back some of my ambitious 
                    plans, prioritizing feasibility within the time frame ultimately led to a more focused and cohesive project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In hindsight, overcoming these challenges has been a valuable learning experience. It has not only strengthened my technical skills but also 
                    taught me the importance of perseverance and strategic planning in project development.

                <h3>Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout the duration of this project, feedback was provided by my peers via an online forum on Blackboard. Our professor encouraged us to 
                    establish a feedback tracker from our classmates, emphasizing the importance of mutual learning and relationship-building. This process not only 
                    facilitated constructive criticism but also nurtured our ability to offer insightful advice on each other's projects. Some particularly valuable 
                    feedback I received included, "(insert feedback)" and "(insert feedback)."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Engaging in this feedback exchange was very beneficial. Witnessing the diverse ideas and processes from my peers was both inspiring and motivating. 
                    The opportunity to explore their ideas and methodologies fueled my own creativity and ambition, making the experience absolutely delightful and enlightening.
