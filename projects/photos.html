                <h1>Photography Project</h1>
                <h2>My First Experience With Animation</h2>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    
                As part of my MART 201 coursework, I learned about DSLR photography using Canon T5i and T3i cameras. The class covered different camera angles and filming 
                techniques. For my project, I took four photos of my friend to tell a story with different types of shots: extreme close-ups, close-ups, long shots, and medium shots.

                I carefully planned and took each photo to show what I learned in class. This project helped me practice using the cameras and understand how to compose 
                good shots. It was a hands-on way to apply what I learned in class to real photography situations. For my project, each photo represented a different shot and expressed a visual story.
                Here, the story of the project is about a student who is hungry and finds a granola bar, expressing a different emotion in each photo.

                Overall, this project was a chance for me to showcase my skills as a student and learn more about photography.

                <h3>Background and Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    This class provided a foundation in understanding the technical aspects of these cameras and exploring various shooting angles and filming techniques. As a college student passionate 
                    about media arts, I saw this course as an opportunity to expand my knowledge and practical skills in photography.

                <h3>Development Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    While the MART 201 course provided valuable insights into DSLR photography, I encountered several challenges during the project. One of the main challenges was 
                    mastering the technical aspects of the Canon T5i and T3i cameras, such as understanding aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings. Additionally, ensuring proper 
                    composition and framing for each shot proved to be another hurdle, as it required careful planning and attention to detail.

                    Furthermore, coordinating with my friend to be the subject for the photoshoot posed logistical challenges, such as scheduling conflicts and finding suitable 
                    locations for shooting. Additionally, capturing the desired shots, especially extreme close-ups and long shots, required experimentation and patience to achieve 
                    the desired results.

                    Despite these challenges, I approached the project with determination and perseverance, using each obstacle as an opportunity to learn and grow as a photographer. 
                    Through trial and error, I was able to overcome these challenges and produce a series of photographs that reflected both my technical skills and creative vision.
