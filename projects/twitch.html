                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project represents a pivotal step towards realizing my dream of generating passive income as a resourceful college student. 
                    Motivated by a desire to leverage my creativity and technical skills, I embarked on the journey of creating my first listing of 
                    streaming overlays tailored for platforms like Twitch.

                    Over the course of four months, I meticulously crafted a comprehensive package of assets designed to enhance the visual appeal and 
                    functionality of streaming channels. This included adjustable assets, pre-made screens, animated screens, customizable background screens, 
                    static screens, and panels, catering to the diverse needs of content creators.

                <h3>Background and Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    Utilizing accessible tools such as my iPad, Canva, and Photoshop, I immersed myself in the process of design and customization, exploring 
                    various techniques to bring my vision to life. Despite the challenges posed by limited resources and time constraints, I remained dedicated 
                    to refining my creations and delivering a high-quality product.

                    Through this project, I not only honed my skills in graphic design and digital artistry but also gained valuable experience in entrepreneurship 
                    and marketing. It served as a testament to my ingenuity and determination to carve out opportunities for myself, even in the face of financial 
                    constraints.

                    Ultimately, this project represents more than just a venture into the realm of passive income; it embodies my passion for creativity, my commitment 
                    to personal growth, and my unwavering drive to pursue my dreams, no matter the obstacles.
