                <h2>Intro to Web Development</h2>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This assignment portal serves as a central hub for my CSCE242 course, Web Applications. It guides students through various stages 
                    of learning, starting from the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, progressing to more advanced topics such as page layouts. Additionally, 
                    students explore JavaScript basics, including the implementation of interactive elements like buttons. Towards the end of the portal, 
                    project assignments are showcased, providing a comprehensive view of the development process. Visitors can trace the evolution of this 
                    portfolio, from initial wireframes created with Mockitt to the final project pitch.

                <h3>Development Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout the learning process of creating a website, I encountered several challenges, including grasping the concepts of flexboxes and 
                    flex containers for layout design, coding JavaScript functions effectively, and adapting to outdated code resources found online to modern 
                    standards preferred in my course.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even overcoming imposter syndrome and learning to foster confidence in my coding and creative abilities for web development posed challenges. 
                    However, as a newcomer to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and both frontend and backend web development, this journey has been inspiring. I've learned 
                    the importance of continuous research and seeking help when needed. Leveraging my resources to the fullest has enabled me to extract the most 
                    value from this experience. Even with numerous challenges, they push me forward and feels incredibly rewarding when the website functions 
                    exactly as intended! Truly exciting and fun!

                <h3>Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout this project, I received feedback from both the class TA and my professor, which proved to be invaluable and highly motivating. 
                    One particularly beneficial skill we learned was the hamburger feedback technique, where feedback is structured to include something positive, 
                    an area for improvement, and another positive aspect. Practicing this technique in class was incredibly beneficial and provided us with a 
                    structured approach to giving and receiving feedback. It not only allowed us to see what our peers were working on and gather ideas but also 
                    enabled us to refine our feedback-giving skills. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn how to provide constructive feedback to others and 
                    deeply appreciate the feedback I received in return.
